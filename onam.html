<p>Onam is the most important and popular festival of Kerala, celebrated with great joy and enthusiasm. It marks the homecoming of the legendary King Mahabali, whose reign is remembered as a golden age of peace, prosperity, and equality. The festival usually falls in the Malayalam month of Chingam (August–September) and lasts for ten days.

People celebrate Onam with traditional activities such as Pookalam (floral rangoli), Vallamkali (snake boat races), Pulikali (tiger dance), and cultural performances. The highlight of the festival is the grand Onam Sadya, a vegetarian feast served on a banana leaf, which includes a wide variety of delicious dishes. Homes and public spaces are decorated beautifully, and everyone wears traditional attire.

Onam is not just a festival of Kerala but a symbol of unity, harmony, and cultural pride. It brings people together irrespective of caste or religion, spreading the message of equality and togetherness.</p>
