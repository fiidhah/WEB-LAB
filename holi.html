<p>Holi is a famous festival of colors celebrated all over India with great joy and excitement. It usually takes place in the month of March and marks the arrival of spring. Holi is also known as the festival of love and unity because it brings people together, forgetting differences.

On this day, people play with colored powders, spray water, sing, dance, and enjoy festive foods like gujiya and thandai. The night before Holi, people light a bonfire called Holika Dahan, which symbolizes the victory of good over evil.

Holi spreads happiness, friendship, and togetherness. It teaches us the values of love, forgiveness, and unity.</p>
