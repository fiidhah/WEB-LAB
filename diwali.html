<p>Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most important and widely celebrated festivals in India. It usually falls in October or November and marks the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. The festival is associated with Lord Rama’s return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana, as described in the Ramayana.

People celebrate Diwali by cleaning and decorating their homes, lighting oil lamps (diyas), bursting fireworks, and exchanging sweets and gifts. The highlight of the festival is the bright illumination of homes and streets, symbolizing joy and prosperity. Special prayers are offered to Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth, for happiness and good fortune.

Diwali spreads love, unity, and positivity. It teaches us the importance of truth, goodness, and the triumph of righteousness in life.</p>
